 '## Overview'
 ''
 '`MakeHelpers` is a package that helps you building a new version of a package, or an application, or anything'
 'in between. It does not do the job for you, but it makes it easier.'
 ''
 'Many helpers work in any case, but some, like `EstablishProjectFolder`, only work in conjunction with the '
 'project manager [Cider](https://github.com/aplteam/Cider "Link to Cider on GitHub").'
 ''
 '## Highlights'
 ''
 '### Version numbers'
 ''
 'Version numbers can be either ruled by a package configuration file or by a `Version` function, especially '
 'when a project does not end up as a package.'
 ''
 'The `CompileVersionNumberPattern` and `IncreaseBuildIDInFunction` functions are intended to'
 'help manage version numbers, be it in a package config file or in a `Version` function which in turn can'
 'be a function in a normal namespace, in a scripted namespace or in a class.'
 ''
 'While a version number without a build number does not necessarily need to be updated when a new version is '
 'built, the build number will always be bumped.'
 ''
 'The functions `DropBuildNumber` and `SplitVersionFromBuildNumber` offer further assistance.'
 ''
 '#### CompileVersionNumberPattern                                       '
 ''
 'Tatin''s `BuildPackage` function does both, setting the "version" variable in a package config file and'
 'bumping the build number, but `CompileVersionNumberPattern` helps by compiling a pattern which can be passed '
 'to `BuildPackage` as part of the right argument, see there for details.'
 ''
 '#### IncreaseBuildIDInFunction'
 ''
 'Whenever a new version is build, the build number needs to be updated. The `IncreaseBuildIDInFunction` takes'
 'a path pointing to a function in a normal namespace, a namespace script or a class script. The code is'
 'modified by bumping the build number, and Link is notified of the change. '
 ''
 '#### CreateAPI'
 ''
 'Use this to build an API automatically.'
 '                                  '
 ''
 '### Create installer EXE with Inno'
 ''
 '`MakeStandAloneRunTimeExe` requires the installer package "Inno" and creates an installer EXE with it, '
 'therefore this is Windows-only. `RemoveStuffButSetupExe` can then be used to remove stuff that is only '
 'required to create the installer EXE, but not afterwards.'
