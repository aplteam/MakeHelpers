# Testing CopyPackageFolderTo

This folder carries test data used to test the `CopyPackageFolderTo` function.

The sub-folders pretend to be packages, but they are actually empty.

There are two tests:

* One copies the folder as it stands to a temp folder
* One copies only the two files two a temp folder, and then attempts to copy that temp folder to another temp folder
